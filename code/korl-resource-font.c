/** @TODO: delete; these are just transient notes on design considerations for FONT resources; except, maybe keep the notes about the final chosen implementation's limitations
 * To cater to the scenario where FONT resources retain all baked glyph data between memoryStates:
 * Even if korl-resource-font is backed by ASSET_CACHE, we _still_ need to 
 * manage _runtime_ memory because we need to remember the Korl_Resource_Handles 
 * of our glyph mesh vertices & glyph page textures.  
 * CONSEQUENCES: 
 *  - we store a ton of unnecessary data in memoryState
 *    - needlessly more work during _all_ frames of program execution :(
 *  - we wont be able to hot-reload font assets, since we would have no way of updating BUFFER assets which utilize the output of a FONT asset
 * 
 * To cater to the scenario where all baked FONT data is _transient_: 
 * We need to establish the idea of parent-backed resources.  In this scenario, 
 * we create a TEXT2D resource, and the FONT resource is completely wiped, since 
 * all glyph data can be re-baked using assetCache-backed data.  When our 
 * transient data is wiped, we need to ensure that all parent-backed resources 
 * (in this case, all our TEXT2D child resources) are unloaded during 
 * `korl_resource_memoryStateRead` & `korl_resource_onAssetHotReload`!  
 * CONSEQUENCES: 
 *  - the user who just wants to draw text is now burdoned with an API abstraction, so we need to ensure this is as flexible as possible
 *  - drawing transient (one-frame) text becomes a burdon, as we can't just call {`resource_create`; `draw`; `resource_destroy`} right now, 
 *    since the text resource would be destroyed before the renderer actually gets a chance to use it; 
 *    we would need to refactor korl-resource to defer total destruction of a resource until end-of-frame
 *    COMPLEXITY++ UUUUUUUUUGH
 * 
 * Here's a question: do we even actually _want_/_need_ to support FONT resource hot-reloading?!... HMMMMMMMmmmmm ðŸ¤”
 * We probably do want all these features.  I want to actually try first before giving up on this.
 * 
 * What if FONT resource data _was_ _all_ transient?  What would happen if it was 
 * actually just wiped when we load a memory state?  I dunno, this just feels bad; 
 * things just wouldn't load correctly between save states and, at best, look glitchy, while at worst, the program would just straight up crash...
 * 
 * It feels like, at the very least, we should adopt a strategy where _some_ of 
 * the font data is transient (GlyphMeshVertices, GlyphPages), and a _minimal_ amount of data 
 * necessary to perfectly re-create the FONT resource is runtime (BakedGlyphs).  
 * If we just had the assetCache data + BakedGlyph data (and _maybe_ GlyphPage packing data; it should be possible to re-create this as well by performing a sort on the BakedGlyph data), 
 * we could fully re-create _all_ multimedia assets (GlyphMeshVertices & GlyphPageTextures), 
 * which _should_ be the _vast_ majority of the data for a FONT asset in the first place!  
 * If we were able to achieve this, we should _not_ have to do silly nonsense like making 
 * special TEXT2D child resources or something like that, since all BUFFER data for drawing text
 * (glyph instance IDs & positions) _will_ remain valid!
 * 
 * After thinking about this for a bit, the above paragraph is actually _not_ true; 
 * imagine scenarios where the font asset is hot-reloaded, and the new font changes a glyph's geometry in some way, 
 * such as making a glyph larger, or making an "empty" glyph have non-zero geometry; 
 * in such cases, we can't possibly place the BakedGlyph in a GlyphPage in such a way that all GFX_BUFFER objects containing 
 * glyph instance data will remain valid anymore; this is because all glyph instance positions are based on the effects of 
 * all previous glyph positions in any given text "line" draw call; so, if any of the metrics of _any_ previous glyphs in a 
 * line has changed, that glyph instance position2d _must_ be adjusted to accommodate this change.
 * 
 * Is it _okay_ to accept the above paragraph as a limitation of korl-resource-font?  
 * All this would mean is that, although hot-reloading of FONT resources would work, 
 * and text buffers generated from said FONT resources would still draw the correct glyphs, 
 * we wouldn't be able to:
 * - draw glyphs which changed "empty" state to "not-empty"
 * - _not_ draw glyphs which changed from "not-empty" => "empty"
 * - draw glyphs in the correct positions for BUFFERs generated pre-font-update
 * These limitations are not terrible, and I don't see them as being a huge issue in _most_ scenarios.  
 * At the very least, we would be able to hot-reload FONT assets & see glyph changes immediately for testing purposes.
