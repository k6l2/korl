@REM Variables created here that are in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE will be carried all 
@REM the way to the actual build command.  Other variables like camelCase ones 
@REM will be optionally used/discarded in specific configuration scripts.

rem ----- set common disabled warnings -----
rem 4061: enumerator 'X' in switch of enum '<X>' is not explicitly handled by a 
rem       case label; WHO CARES?  4062 will prevent us from not having at least 
rem       a default case to handle these enum values, which should catch most of 
rem       these types of bugs, assuming you write decent default case logic...  
rem       I just don't think this warning is useful since it seems more useful 
rem       to have the ability to switch on a subset of enum values, and dump the 
rem       rest into the default case.
rem 4201: nonstandard extension used: nameless struct/union; this would be a 
rem       problem if we cared about supporting C98 (these were added in C11)
rem 4505: unreferenced function with internal linkage has been removed; this is 
rem       completely useless as far as I can tell, since if we try to call a 
rem       function that isn't defined in the module, the compiler will complain
rem 4514: unreferenced inline function has been removed; see 4505
rem 4706: assignment within conditional expression; I will leave this off until 
rem       the day that I ever make a mistake which this would have caught
rem 4710: function not inlined; I just don't care about this, and don't see 
rem       myself caring about this anytime soon
rem 4711: function 'X' selected for automatic inline expansion; this only 
rem       happens in optimized builds, and I don't really care about code size 
rem       metrics or how the asm looks at all right now.  Maybe in the future...
